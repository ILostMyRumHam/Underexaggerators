![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ecd86e0-0453-4440-9018-3fe19d02f5c1)# Underexaggerators

The rise of an isolationism that annihilates to save face, and pretty smart computers.

# 1.

I won't complain if you stop.

I didn't think I'd find it in me.

The will to say the awkward things. 

No free will, just what you'll see 

The blotted pixels, soggy wills

Drifting somewhere lost at sea.


Pretty botched start.  But since I am my first reader, I am also the first reader to suspend my disbelief in the words I write. Other readers are free to diverge.
